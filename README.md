# AI4HAB

Welcome to AI4HAB - This project aims to design and deploy a multi-agent AI system for the intelligent monitoring, prediction, and response to Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) in freshwater lakes.

**Key Objectives**
1. Develop an agent-based architecture combining environmental sensing, satellite data, and AI models

2. Harmonize multi-source data for real-time and historical analysis

3. Forecast the occurrence, intensity, and spread of HABs using machine learning

4. Generate early warnings and actionable insights for local authorities and citizens

5. Ensure system interpretability through explainable AI (XAI) components

6. Continuously improve through feedback loops and adaptive learning

7. Apply the system to various lake types, with a focus on German water bodies


Our toolkit currently consists of the following agents:
1. **HOMOGEN**: Ingests, cleans, aligns, and fuses heterogeneous sensor, satellite, and meteorological data.
2. **CALIBRO**: Calibrate Earth Observation (EO) data using in-situ ground truth.
3. **PREDIKT**: Predicts the likelihood, intensity, and spatial spread of HABs using machine learning models.
4. **DETEKTA**: Identifies ongoing or imminent HAB events based on real-time data and imagery.
5. **REACTOR**: Translates predictions into actions, alerts, and recommendations for stakeholders.
6. **EXPLAINA**:Explains model outputs and agent decisions in human-understandable terms.
7. **VISIOS**: â€¢	Enable end-users to capture images of surface waters and receive real-time insights.
8. **FEEDBACKO**: Monitors agent outputs, user feedback, and external data to drive continuous learning.
9. **Talk2PDFs**: Reads the government policies in terms of PDF.
